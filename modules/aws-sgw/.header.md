# AWS Storage Gateway Terraform sub-module

Deploys a Storage Gateway on AWS, configures Storage Gateway cache and maps it to a local storage disk. Requires the Storage Gateway appliance to be deployed first using the module [vmware-sgw](../vmware-sgw/) or the [ec2-sgw](../ec2-sgw/). For an end to end examples refer to the [examples directory](../../examples/)

# AWS Storage Gateway types 

- Amazon S3 File Gateway (FILE_S3)
- Amazon FSx File Gateway (FILE_FSX_SMB)
- Tape Gateway (VTL)
- Volume Gateway (CACHED, STORED)

The module requires a Gateway Type to be declared with a default set to FILE_S3. For more details regarding the Storage Gateway types and their respective arguments can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/storagegateway_gateway)
